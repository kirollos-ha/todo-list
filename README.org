#+TITLE:TODO-LIST
a simple todo list manager

* Compiling and using
** Dependencies
 - qt5
 - cmake
 - build and run scripts require ~sh~
   (posix shell, linux or macos work out of the box)
 - test script requires ~bash~
   (and ~date~, but that's usually preinstalled)

** Compiling
in the project root directory (the one you cloned with the ~.git/~), run
#+begin_src sh
./lebuild
#+end_src

** Running the tests
in the project root directory
#+begin_src sh
./letest
#+end_src
you can run
#+begin_src sh
./letest clean
#+end_src
to remove any preexisting compilation artifacts and recompile everything before running the tests 

** Running the program
in the project root directory run
#+begin_src sh
./lerun
#+end_src
or
#+begin_src sh
./build/todo
#+end_src
(they do the exact same thing, ~./lerun~ is just a more convenient way to do it)

* Features present
 - View and edit todo lists through a graphical user interface
 - Read and write todo lists to and from files
 - Not segfaulting (experimental)

* Features to be added
 - +A working GUI+ (done)
 - Decent documentation
